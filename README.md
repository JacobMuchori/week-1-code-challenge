# week-1-code-challenge

# Description
This code challenge contains:
 1.A function that outputs correct grades when student marks are input.
 2.A function that prints a certain message depending on the input speed of a car.
 3.A function that calculates an individuals net salary once the basic salary and benefits are input then added to get the gross salary, then the deductions are calculated and subtracted from the gross salary to get the net salary.It also displays the value of PAYE, NHIF and NSSF deductions.

# Project set up
  # Student Grade Generator(Toy Problem)
The first part of the code challenge contains a variable declaration for student marks.Once the value of marks is input in the parentheses, the giveGrades function will compute a certain output grade for the value on the terminal when (node index.js) is run.This grade output changes as the mark input is changed beyond the ranges given.
 
  # Speed Detector(Toy Problem)
The second part contains the speed variable which we will input our speed in the parentheses.This input will cause the function printReceipt to output "Ok" for speed below 70.For speeds above 70, a demerit point will be awarded for every increment of five.Above 12 demerit points the output will be "license suspended".All the output will be displayed in the terminal when (node index.js) is run.

 # Net Salary Calculator(Toy Problem)
for the last code challenge,we will input any value of basic salary and benefits we receive in our monthly payments in the parentheses.With the input, the function IndividualNetSalary calculator will calculate the net salary the individual gets per month after deductions.The funtion will also outpu NHIF,NSSF and PAYE deductions done to derive the net salary.All these values will be seen in the terminal when we run node index.js
